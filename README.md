## This is an implementation of Deep Q learning algorithm using OpenAI-gym and keras.

### Requirements

* Gym
* Keras
* h5py


### Here it tries to play a classical cartpole game.

### Train and Test

* If you want to train the neural network model from scratch, make `test_cart = False`.
* Currently it uses a previously trained model.
